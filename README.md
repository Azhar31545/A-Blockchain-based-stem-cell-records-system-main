# Blockchain Stem Cell Record System
This repository contains the source code for a research-based team project that aimed to develop a blockchain-based storage and sharing scheme for stem cell records. The project was conducted under the guidance of Asst. Prof. Amanpreet Singh Saini and focused on enhancing the security, transparency, and accessibility of stem cell records by leveraging blockchain technology.

As a key contributor to the project, my primary focus was on front-end development using React, a widely-used JavaScript library for building user interfaces. The front-end interface acts as a user-friendly platform for interacting with the blockchain network and managing stem cell records securely.

## Technologies Used:
Front-end: React.js <br>
Smart Contracts: Solidity <br>
Blockchain Platform: Ethereum <br>
Web3.js <br>
HTML, CSS, JavaScript

## Setup
1. Download Metamask Extension from Chrome
2. Set your wallet to the Goerli test network
3. Get ETH from Goerli Faucet

## How to Run System
```
npm run start
```

## How to Run Tests
```
npm run test
```

## Whenever there is a change in Solidity code, use these commands
```
cd ethereum
node compile.js
node deploy.js
```
